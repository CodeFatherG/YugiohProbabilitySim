# Probi-Oh!

This project is a web based Yugioh simulation project aimed at a more complex system. Cards can have tags in addition to their names to allow for your outcomes to be more complex. In addition, if there are multiple ways to achieve your outcome, you can specify many outcomes and get the probability of each outcome.

# Todo

- [ ] Better free card logic
